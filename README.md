poplar-heap is a collection of heap algorithms programmed in C++14 whose signatures more or less conrrespond to those
of the standard library's heap algorithms. However, they use what is known as a "poplar heap" instead of a traditional
binary heap to store the data. A poplar heap is a data structure introduced by Coenraad Bron and Wim H. Hesselink in
their paper *Smoothsort revisited*. We will first describe the library interface, then explain what a poplar heap is,
and how to implement and improve the usual heap operations with poplar heaps.

Now, let's be real: compared to usual binary heap-based based functions, poplar heap-based functions are slow. This
library does not mean to provide performant algorithms. Its goals are different:
* Explaining what poplar heaps are
* Showing how poplar heaps can be implemented with O(1) extra space
* Showing that operations used in poplar sort can be decoupled
* Providing a proof-of-concept implementation

## The heap algorithms

The following functions are provided by the poplar-heap library:

```cpp
template<
    typename RandomAccessIterator,
    typename Compare = std::less<>
>
void pop_heap(RandomAccessIterator first, RandomAccessIterator last,
              Compare compare={});
```

*Requires:* The range `[first, last)` shall be a valid non-empty poplar heap. `RandomAccessIterator` shall satisfy the
requirements of `ValueSwappable`. The type of `*first` shall satisfy the requirements of `MoveConstructible` and of
`MoveAssignable`.

*Effects:* Swaps the highest value in `[first, last)` with the value in the location `last - 1` and makes
`[first, last - 1)` into a poplar heap.

*Complexity:* O(log(`last - first`)) comparisons.

```cpp
template<
    typename RandomAccessIterator,
    typename Compare = std::less<>
>
void make_heap(RandomAccessIterator first, RandomAccessIterator last,
               Compare compare={});
```

*Requires:* The type of `*first` shall satisfy the `MoveConstructible` requirements and the `MoveAssignable`
requirements.

*Effects:* Constructs a poplar heap out of the range `[first, last)`.

*Complexity:* O(`last - first`) comparisons. 

```cpp
template<
    typename RandomAccessIterator,
    typename Compare = std::less<>
>
void sort_heap(RandomAccessIterator first, RandomAccessIterator last,
               Compare compare={});
```

*Requires:* The range `[first, last)` shall be a valid poplar heap. `RandomAccessIterator` shall satisfy the
requirements of `ValueSwappable`. The type of `*first` shall satisfy the requirements of `MoveConstructible` and of
`MoveAssignable`.

*Effects:* Sorts elements in the poplar heap `[first, last)`.

*Complexity:* O(*N* log(*N*)) comparisons, where *N* = `last - first`.
